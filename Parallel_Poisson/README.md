# Parallel Poisson

We solve the 2D Poisson (or Laplace) equation with several different parallel processing libraries.

The results are compared to a serial solution as well as each other.


This project uses [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) to visualize calculated matrices. Paraview can be installed in Ubuntu with  
  
	sudo apt install paraview
